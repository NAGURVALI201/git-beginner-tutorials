Git command learned.
-------------------
- git add
- git log
- git init
- git status
- git commit
- git diff <hash1> <hash2>

- git checkout <hash> To move to any previous commit in past.It gives you the detached head.
- If we commit the changes at that point when we go back the commit and add will be lost to prevent them we should use the command
- git branch <branch_name> <hash> It will create a new branch from the detached head.
